<p>Most of us own some sort of property. It came be a simple house to a larger apartment or a office/factory complex. Other than what’s mentioned monthly bill, do you have an idea of what your utility usage is? And how live is that data?

How many of you dream of watering your plants or controlling or status checking  devices at properties  remotely?</p>

<h3>
<a id="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h3>

<p>As we understood it is not because of the technology gaps. Smart utility metering with remote management capabilities are already out there. But making it more intelligent is the challenge. Our solution is to provide an extensible platform which could intelligently empower your needs in remote property management by combining the power of smart utility metering and managing your appliances more effectively while saving your money and time.</p>

<p>
  For example by analysing utility metering and usage patterns of heated water using electricity, you can now decide if going for solar panels is a worthy investment. Or decide how your factory work shifts should be created to optimise usage vs bill payments.
</p>

<p>Your plantation will never look the same.
If you need to water your plants with a schedule but also considering the weather conditions and the water pressure level from your domestic water supplier, then our solution will be the best for you. We are connecting with your utility meter for the water supply and will intelligently understand what is the pressure variation, then understanding the weather conditions we will make the decision to water your plants.</p>
